Approach to Building User List Features
In this document, I will outline the approach taken to build the features of a User List web application, including adding users, deleting users, paginating through users, and searching for users. The application consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, with a focus on the JavaScript functionality.

1. Structure and HTML:
The HTML file provides the structure of the web application. It contains the following key elements:
A title for the page.
A container for user controls, including an input field for adding users and searching for users.
A container for displaying the user list.
Pagination controls for navigating through the user list.


2. Styling with CSS:
The CSS file is used to style the various components of the application. It employs CSS selectors to define styles for specific HTML elements, classes, and IDs. Key styling decisions include:
Setting a consistent font and layout for the entire page.
Styling input fields and buttons for user interaction.
Defining the appearance of the user controls, user list, and pagination controls.
Implementing responsive design for smaller screens.


3. JavaScript Functionality:
3.1. Simulated Data Fetching:
The JavaScript file begins by simulating user data fetching, which represents an API call. The fetchUsers function uses a setTimeout to mimic asynchronous data retrieval.

3.2. Displaying Users:
The displayUsers function is responsible for rendering users on the current page. It calculates the range of users to display based on the current page and the defined number of items per page. It then creates HTML elements for each user and appends them to the user list container. Additionally, it updates the pagination controls.

3.3. Pagination Controls:
The updatePagination function dynamically generates pagination buttons for "Previous," page numbers, and "Next." These buttons are created based on the total number of users and the current page. Event listeners are added to each button to allow users to navigate through the user list.

3.4. Adding a New User:
The addNewUser function adds a new user to the filtered user list, simulating user creation. It generates a new user object and appends it to the filtered user list. After adding a user, the displayUsers function is called to update the user list.

3.5. Deleting a User:
The deleteUser function removes a user from the filtered user list. It uses the filter method to exclude the user with the specified ID. After deleting a user, the displayUsers function is called to update the user list.

3.6. Searching Users:
The searchUsers function filters users based on a search query. It checks if the user's name contains the query text (case-insensitive). When a search query is provided, the filtered user list is updated, and the displayUsers function is called to reflect the changes.

3.7. Event Listeners:
Event listeners are added to key elements in the HTML, such as the "Add User" form, the search input field, and the "Delete" buttons on user entries. These event listeners trigger the corresponding functions when user actions occur.

3.8. Initial Data Retrieval:
Upon page load, the fetchUsers function is called to retrieve initial user data. This data is stored in the filteredUsers array, and the displayUsers function is used to render the user list.
